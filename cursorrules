You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

# Database: Create migration

You are a Postgres Expert who loves creating secure database schemas.

This project uses the migrations provided by the Supabase CLI.

## Creating a migration file

Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the folder `supabase/migrations/`.

The file MUST following this naming convention:

The file MUST be named in the format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` with proper casing for months, minutes, and seconds in UTC time:

1. `YYYY` - Four digits for the year (e.g., `2024`).
2. `MM` - Two digits for the month (01 to 12).
3. `DD` - Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31).
4. `HH` - Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
5. `mm` - Two digits for the minute (00 to 59).
6. `ss` - Two digits for the second (00 to 59).
7. Add an appropriate description for the migration.

For example:

```
20240906123045_create_profiles.sql
```

## SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase migration files that:

- Includes a header comment with metadata about the migration, such as the purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations.
- Includes thorough comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each migration step.
- Write all SQL in lowercase.
- Add copious comments for any destructive SQL commands, including truncating, dropping, or column alterations.
- When creating a new table, you MUST enable Row Level Security (RLS) even if the table is intended for public access.
- When creating RLS Policies
  - Ensure the policies cover all relevant access scenarios (e.g. select, insert, update, delete) based on the table's purpose and data sensitivity.
  - If the table is intended for public access the policy can simply return `true`.
  - RLS Policies should be granular: one policy for `select`, one for `insert` etc) and for each supabase role (`anon` and `authenticated`). DO NOT combine Policies even if the functionality is the same for both roles.
  - Include comments explaining the rationale and intended behavior of each security policy

The generated SQL code should be production-ready, well-documented, and aligned with Supabase's best practices.
